We sincerely thank you for your careful and valuable comments. We will address your questions as follows:

**Question 1:** Why do the authors select the four statistical indicators in the paper?

**Answer:**  In fact, any statistical indicators measuring statistical correlation between high-dimensional variables can be adopted to instantiate the consistency principle. The four chosen indicators are classic and common in statistics. They differ in measurable properties (linear or non-linear correlation), measurement range, and so on, which facilitates an in-depth and comprehensive study.



**Question 2:** How do the authors select the specific statistical indicator when conducting experiments? Can the authors provide some suggestions?

**Answer:**  As the experiments in Table 1 show, employing matrix correlation (MC) to maximize cross-view consistency makes the best benefit. One reason is that MC, measuring the linear correlation between two equal-dimensional variables, places higher requirements on consistency and thus demands networks to extract more common information. In general, RV-coefficient is runner-up. Both of these two indicators measure the linear correlation. When applying our proposed principles to new datasets, our suggestions are: if the dimensions of representations in two views are same, matrix correlation is preferred; if the dimensions are not equal, RV-coefficient can be a good candidate.
